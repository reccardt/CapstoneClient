	 In the first year, the National Piano Manufacturers Association recommends that you have your piano tuned four times. They, and nearly all piano manufacturers, recommend that your piano should be tuned at least twice a year thereafter. Call Paul at 516  326-6944 or e-mail him at <a href='mailto:paul@paulspianos.com'>paul@paulspianos.com</a> to make an appointment.
